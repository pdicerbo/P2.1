Some comments
==============================================

This is a brief report about the exercises done during the P2.1.
I'm really sorry, but I don't have enough time to implement the **hybrid sort** because I spent to much time
to implement by myself the **merge sort** algorithm. In each folder (D1, D2, D3), **make** will produce
the executable corresponding to the ##_name.f90 source code. In D2/part-2/results you can find
some timing data obtained running the correspondent executable. I'm really sorry, but I don't have enough
time to comment these results. However, each code is valgrind clean and for details about the implementation
you can directly ask to me.

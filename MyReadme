Some comments
==============================================

This is a brief report about the exercises done during the P2.1.
I'm really sorry, but I don't have enough time to implement the **hybrid sort** because I spent too much time
in implementing the **merge sort** algorithm by myself. In each folder (D1, D2, D3), **make** will produce
the executable corresponding to the ##_name.f90 source code. In D2/part-2/results you can find
some timing data obtained by running the related executables. Unfortunately, due to the lack of time I didn't
comment these results. However, each code is **valgrind clean** and if you want some more details about the implementation,
feel free to ask me.
